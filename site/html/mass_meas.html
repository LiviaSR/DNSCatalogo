        <h5>Mass measurements</h5>

    <div class="text-section">
        <p>The vast majority of NSs are observed as pulsars, rapidly-rotating and high-magnetized neutron stars emitting beams of
        radiation along its magnetic axis that are seen on Earth as a pulse due to the lighthouse effect
        \citep{rezzolla2018physics}. Nowadays, more than 3300 pulsars were observed (see <a href="https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/">ATNF</a> for a catalogue of radio
        pulsars), but only a tiny fraction of the total sample
        allows mass measurements because observed pulsars are mainly isolated stars and the calculation method is
        based on orbital motions, although efforts are already made to provide mass measurements of isolated NSs.
        </p>
        
        <p>The extreme regularity of the pulses, responsible for recognizing pulsars as the most stable clocks in the observable
        universe, makes pulsar timing the most accurate method to determine their masses, as well as test fundamental
        physics. The procedure consists in monitoring the times-of-arrival (TOAs) of pulses over several years to determine the
        pulsar's rotation period. Thanks to the regularity, small deviations of TOAs are detectable with precision. Additional
        parameters of pulsar and its orbit (in binary systems) are also obtained from pulsar timing.
        </p>
        
        <p>The orbital motion of binary systems is described by five Keplerian parameters: binary period (\(P_b\)), projection of pulsar's
        semimajor axis (\(a_p\)) on the line of sight \(x_p = a_p \sin{i}\), eccentricity (\(e\)), time (\(T_0\)) and longitude \(\omega\) of
        periastron. The masses of components can be determined from a mass function in light of Kepler's Third Law:
        
        $$
        f_p (m_p, m_c, i) = \frac{\left( m_c \sin{i}\right)^3}{\left( m_p + m_c \right)^2} = \frac{4
        \pi^2}{T_{\odot}}\frac{x_p^3}{P_b^2}, \tag{1}\label{eq1}
        $$
        where \(T_{\odot} \equiv G M_{\odot}/c^3 = 4.925490947~\mu s\) (G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of
        light and \(M_{\odot} \) is the solar mass).
        </p>
        
        <p>Whenever mass functions are measurable, it is possible to obtain individual masses provided the inclination angle \(i\) is
        known, but this quantity is difficult to be inferred with accuracy and the mass function of the companion is only
        obtained in some cases where it is a detectable pulsar or a star with an observable spectrum. However, binary systems
        containing a pulsar are compact and thus some relativistic effects might be observed. The relativistic corrections for
        orbital motion for GR are described in terms of post-Keplerian (PK) parameters, which are functions of Keplerian
        parameters \citep{stairs2003testing}:

                <li>Orbital period decay, \( \dot{P_b} \):
                $$ \dot{P_b} = -\frac{192\pi}{5} \left( \frac{P_b}{2\pi T_{\odot}}\right)^{-\frac{5}{3}} \left( 1 + \frac{73}{24}e^2 +
                \frac{37}{96}e^4 \right) \left(1 - e^2 \right)^{-\frac{7}{2}} \frac{m_p m_c}{m^{1/3}}; \tag{2}\label{eq2}$$

                <li> Shape of Shapiro delay, \(s \):
                $$s = \sin{i} = x_p \left(\frac{P_b}{2\pi} \right)^{-2/3} \frac{m^{2/3}}{T_{\odot}^{1/3}m_c} \tag{4}\label{eq4}$$
                </li>
                <li>Einstein delay, \( \gamma \):
                $$ \gamma = e \left( \frac{P_b}{2\pi} \right)^{1/3} T_{\odot}^{2/3}~ \frac{m_c \left(m_p + 2m_c\right)}{m^{4/3}} \tag{5}\label{eq5} $$

                <li>Advance of periastron, \( \dot{\omega} \):
                $$\dot{\omega} = 3\left(\frac{P_b}{2\pi} \right)^{-5/3} \left( 1 - e^2 \right)^{-1} \left( m~ T_{\odot} \right)^{2/3}. \tag{6}\label{eq6}$$
                </li>
            </ol>

        
        <p>If only one PK parameter is observed, constrains can
        be imposed on individual masses. The observation of any two PK parameters allows unique individual mass determinations,
        and if extra parameters are specified it is possible to test GR
        \citep{Lyne}.</p>
        
        <p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are pulsars with very short spin periods, \( 1 < P < 30~ms \) and \( \dot{P} < 10^{-19}\), which
            were spun-up by its companion during a transfer of angular momentum to the NS, being recycled. These short
            periods make MSPs extremely precise for pulsar timing and they are now recognized as the most useful objects to test
            fundamental physics \citep{ozel2016masses}. For a large number of binaries only one PK parameter is measured, but as
            mentioned before in cases where the companion is optically observed (main sequence, post-main sequence and white
            dwarfs stars) it is possible to provide additional information about the system.
            Phase-resolved spectroscopy
            provides orbital radial velocity amplitude (\(K_c\)), which together with Keplerian parameters yields the mass ratio
            (\(q=m_p/m_c\)). For white dwarfs, particularly, their radii can be estimated if the distance to Earth is known and
            the optical flux and effective temperature are measured. Thus, from a theoretical relation based on their spectrum
            its mass can be obtained, leading to the pulsars mass estimation through the relation of mass ratio. For NSs with
            high-mass companions, x-rays emitted by the pulsar are blocked by the companion during part of its orbit, also allowing
            mass measurements. The Shapiro delay, in its turn, consists in an retardation of pulses TOA due to space-time
            curvature near a massive companion. This effect can remain unobserved, even after years of timing, if it is too
            small, but for almost edge-on MSP systems containing a high-mass WD, the effect is strong enough and allows
            extremely precise measurements of both masses.
